Great question. A secondary school result management system has a bit more complexity than a basic grading app because of roles (subject teacher, form teacher, head teacher), classes/arms, terms, and multiple subjects per student.
I’ll walk you through this in a clean, production-ready way, starting from core concepts → database models → relationships, using plain English + table schemas (no code unless you ask).

1. Core Real-World Concepts (Translate to Tables)
In a typical secondary school:
    • A student belongs to one class (and arm) per session
    • A teacher can:
        ◦ Teach one subject in multiple classes
        ◦ Be a form teacher for one class
    • A class has:
        ◦ Many students
        ◦ Many subjects
    • A subject is taught by different teachers in different classes
    • Results are:
        ◦ Per student
        ◦ Per subject
        ◦ Per term & session

2. High-Level Entity List (Tables)
These are the minimum core tables you need:
    1. USERS
    2. ROLES
    3. TEACHERS
    4. STUDENTS
    5. CLASSES
    6. SUBJECTS
    7. CLASS_SUBJECTS
    8. TEACHER_SUBJECT_CLASSES
    9. ACADEMIC_SESSIONS
    10. TERMS
    11. ASSESSMENTS / SCORES
    12. RESULTS
    13. ATTENDANCE
    14. FORM_TEACHERS

3. Database Models (Detailed)

4. Role Responsibilities (System Logic)
Subject Teacher
    • Can:
        ◦ Enter scores only for assigned class + subject
    • Cannot:
        ◦ Edit other subjects or classes

Form Teacher
    • Can:
        ◦ View all students in their class
        ◦ View compiled results
        ◦ Add remarks
    • Cannot:
        ◦ Change subject scores

Head Teacher
    • Can:
        ◦ View all classes
        ◦ Lock results
        ◦ Approve results
        ◦ Manage attendance

5. Result Flow (Real Life)
    1. Admin assigns:
        ◦ Subjects to classes
        ◦ Teachers to subjects/classes
    2. Subject teacher enters scores
    3. System calculates totals, grades, positions
    4. Form teacher adds remarks
    5. Head teacher approves & locks results

6. Optional Advanced Tables (If You Want to Scale)
    • GRADING_SYSTEM
    • PROMOTION_RULES
    • AFFECTIVE_TRAITS (Behavior, punctuality)
    • PSYCHOMOTOR_SKILLS

7. ERD (Text View)
TEACHERS ---< TEACHER_SUBJECT_CLASSES >--- SUBJECTS
      |
      v
 FORM_TEACHERS --- CLASSES ---< STUDENTS
      |
      v
    RESULTS >--- ASSESSMENTS

8. Tech Stack Friendly
This schema works perfectly with:
    • Django ORM
    • SQLAlchemy
    • Prisma
    • Sequelize
    • Laravel Eloquent
